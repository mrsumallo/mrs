        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Marie Sumallo. BSIT student from paterostechnological college, 20, I'm passionate about expressing myself through music and art. Singing is one of my greatest joys, allowing me to connect with emotions and stories through melody. I also love drawing, where I can bring my creativity to life on paper, whether through sketches, portraits, or intricate designs.

            In addition to singing and drawing, I enjoy playing musical instruments, particularly the kalimba and ukulele. The kalimbaâ€™s soothing, melodic tones help me relax, while the ukulele's cheerful strums bring a fun and uplifting energy to my music. Playing these instruments allows me to explore different sounds and create unique melodies.
            
            Overall, my interests reflect my love for creativity and artistic expression, whether through visual arts, singing, or instrumental music.</
